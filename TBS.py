""" Create dog walking app """
# connect to database (SQLITE that syncs with online data)

# API's- weather (temperature), maps to track routes, find lost last location


# ***Weather***
# Heat stroke, frostbite, dehydration risks (Chart?)
# emergency weather alerts

# ***Counter***
# for daily logs for walks- to reset at midnight
# Stats would show daily, weekly,monthly and annual totals to date.

# ***Mapping***
# for fitness goals --- See Stats
#  Also for warnings of dangerous areas or approaching/ unfriendly/ non social pets
# Live tracking/ share with firends/ family
# best/ new sniffing areas

# ***Pet Profile:***
# Photos
# Vetranairian
# Medicines, vacines
# Alergies
# name , owners name, cell # (possibly hidden and send message through app?)
# Age, Breed, sex, eye colour, colour(s), other(birthmarks), weight
# Diet (brands), treats amounts
# Emergency contact
#  Emergency alert broadcast for given map area.

# ***Stats***
# Distance walked
# Most often sniffed
# Most common area sniffed
# Challenges and results
# Manual adding?
# Health issues ( runs, sickness, tiredness)

# ***Hardware *** (Colllar)
# If it is a leash, it could collect heart rate and pets temperature ofr duress situations.
# Bluetooth for nearby and "herd" alerts if there are other members nearby with their app open, they could be alerted for lost pet etc.

# ***Hardware Part 2***(Tag)
# local air temp

# ***Notifications and reminders***
# Temperature  = Hydration, frostbite
# Duress body temperature warnings
# Weather warnings = geolocation

# ***Apple watch/ other wearable***
# T.P.E total pets earned- by the pets furless money NFC would log if watch is within 1 foot and making petting motion to earn points for the furrless monkey.


# Use the BLIND data to sell to industry related product manufacturers (dog food)- keeps the app cheaper to use.
